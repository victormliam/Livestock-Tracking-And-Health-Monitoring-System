## About the system
This project focused on designing and developing a Livestock and Health Monitoring System to help farmers and veterinary officers monitor livestock location, movement and health in realtime. The system intergrates GPS tracking, temperature sensors, and a mobile/web interface for instant alerts. It addresses challenges such as theft, undetected illness and inefficient manual tracking.
